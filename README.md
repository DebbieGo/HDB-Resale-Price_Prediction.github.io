# HDB Resale Price Prediction

In the competitive Singapore real estate market, **setting the right price for an HDB resale flat is critical**. Real Estate agents need a **reliable, data-driven tool** to move beyond simple comparisons and provide clients with **accurate, justifiable pricing advice**.

The objective of this project is to analyze historical resale data to:

1. Identify the top factors that influence HDB resale prices.

2. Build a highly accurate predictive model to estimate a flat's value.

3. Deliver an interactive tool for agents to use to advise their clients.

In this project, I've developed an advanced XGBoost machine learning model that achieved ** an RÂ² of 0.97, explaining 97% of HDB resale price variability** in Singapore. This represents 49% reduction in average prediction error compared to a standard linear model, proving its ability to capture the complex dynamics of the market. These insights are delivered through **an interactive pricing tool for agents to use to advise their clients effectively**.
